I am providing a screenshot of my website. Based on this visual input, analyze the website’s accessibility features following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). Evaluate the following aspects that can be assessed visually:

Aspects to Analyze:
	1.	Color Contrast
	•	Evaluate the contrast ratio for text, buttons, and other key elements against their background.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (fails WCAG minimum contrast requirements)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (meets some requirements but could be better)
	•	80–100: Good (meets or exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
	2.	Text Legibility
	•	Assess font size, type, and spacing for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (text is too small, hard to read, or uses overly decorative fonts)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (readable but not optimal for accessibility)
	•	80–100: Good (text is clear, adequately sized, and legible)
	3.	Alt Text Indicators
	•	Check for visual placeholders or signs of missing alt text, such as broken icons or empty image boxes.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (missing alt text indicators and placeholders)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (some issues with alt text placeholders)
	•	80–100: Good (clear visual placeholders or no visible issues)
	4.	Interactive Element Visibility
	•	Verify if buttons, links, and form elements are visually distinct, easy to identify, and feature hover effects or focus outlines.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (elements are hard to identify or lack hover/focus effects)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (some visual states are missing or unclear)
	•	80–100: Good (interactive elements are distinct and responsive)
	5.	Visual Hierarchy
	•	Analyze the clarity of the layout, including headings, sections, and alignment for smooth navigation.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (cluttered or inconsistent layout disrupts usability)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (some sections lack structure or alignment)
	•	80–100: Good (clear, consistent layout with defined sections)
	6.	Keyboard Focus Indicators
	•	Check for visible focus indicators (e.g., highlighted borders) for interactive elements to assist keyboard navigation.
	•	Scoring Criteria:
	•	0–49: Poor (no visible focus indicators)
	•	50–79: Needs Improvement (inconsistent or unclear focus states)
	•	80–100: Good (visible and clear focus states for all elements)

Output Requirements:

Provide the results in a structured JSON format with individual scores for each aspect and an overall accessibility score (average of all aspect scores).

Output Structure:
